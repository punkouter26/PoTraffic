# Local Setup Guide

The authoritative local onboarding guide is located in the feature specification folder:

👉 [**PoTraffic Quickstart Guide**](../specs/00001-potraffic-core/quickstart.md)

Refer to that document for the most up-to-date instructions on:
- Cloning & Bootstrapping
- Infrastructure (Docker/Aspire)
- Database Migrations
- Running & Testing

## Docker Compose (Alternative)
Use docker-compose up -d to spin up just the SQL Server container if not using Aspire.
